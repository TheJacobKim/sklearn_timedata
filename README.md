# sklearn_timedata

scikit-learn library allows you to use multiple classifiers and regressors with ease through Python. Each classifier or regresssor has a lot of parameters built in to it. 

The aim of this project is to determine each machine-learning algorithm's runtime with given parameters wihtout actually running the program.

Right now the project is at the stage of gathering data with GridSearchCV.
